# RocketWars

* Introduction:

  This is an application called RocketWars and it is my project that I am going to use for the lab of CIS3513 at Temple University. The overview of this project is that it will be a 2-D based iOS game application. It will be using the Swift programming language and the main function of this application is to run and behave like a working game. This will include things like incorporating images to fit the theme of the game, logic to handle how the game should function, adding sound effects for things when certain action happens, keeping track of lives and etc. My motivation for choosing to do a project like this is because I never done a game appliation before, and I gotten into Computer Science due to my interest for video games, when learning Swift, and the process of mobile development, I really enjoyed Swift as a language. So, since I enjoy Swift, enjoy video games, and always wanted to see how the aspects and logic of games work, why not try one out myself!
