# RocketWars

* Introduction:

  This is an application called RocketWars and it is my project that I am going to use for the lab of CIS3513 at Temple University. The overview of this project is that it will be a 2-D based iOS game application. It will be using the Swift programming language and the main function of this application is to run and behave like a working game. This will include things like incorporating images to fit the theme of the game, logic to handle how the game should function, adding sound effects for things when certain action happens, keeping track of lives and etc. My motivation for choosing to do a project like this is because I never done a game appliation before, and I gotten into Computer Science due to my interest for video games, when learning Swift, and the process of mobile development, I really enjoyed Swift as a language. So, since I enjoy Swift, enjoy video games, and always wanted to see how the aspects and logic of games work, why not try one out myself!
  
* Design:

  The design of this application revolves all around a GameScene. 
  
* Testing:
  
  While writing each line of code, I run the application to see and try to test if anything has changed from the previous state rom when I last tested the code.That way I can see and check step by step that each line of codee is doing what it sjould do and interacting with what it should interact with. I tested things like moving the character off screen, and shooting, to which the sound effect of a bullet firing could be heard even when off screen, so I added lines of code to keep the player object within the GameScene. Testing logic of the code as it is written.
